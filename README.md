Stellaris Parliamentary Mod

This mod is a rudimentary attempt at creating a sort of representative system in Stellaris.
It simply adds two jobs: Parliamentarian and Senator.
Parliamentarian jobs are created every 3 Pops. They produce unity.
Senator jobs are created every 10 Pops. They also produce unity.
Both are Rulers.

In order to access the civic, one must be some degree of Democratic and some degree of Egalitarian.
At the moment, all this mod does is add jobs. I will look at adding more later.
To disable the jobs, simply remove the civic.

This mod does NOT create a working Parliamentary system in gameplay. It is simply for immersion (roleplay) purposes at the moment.

Notes:
The Constituency Office at the moment does nothing. I am looking into this.
